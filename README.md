# OpenWeather Dashboard
Weather Dashboard Concept using OpenWeather API

In this application, I utilize Javascript and jQuery methods, fetch data from Server 
Side Api's, store / sort & delete data from LocalSorage to create an accurate and 
interactive weather forecast dashboard. I utilize Bootstrap, jQuery/UI, Moment.js 
and Touch-Punch libraries to create a sleek & responsive user experience.The application 
automatically locates the user through geo-location, and allows them to save up to 
8 cities for quick access.
